**  Two Sum

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC src
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

#+END_SRC

UPDATE (2016/2/13):

The return format had been changed to zero-based indices. Please read the above updated description carefully.
